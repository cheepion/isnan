## GraphQL requests made easy with React Query and TypeScript

Using a GraphQL API comes with distinct advantages. With GraphQL, we can request the exact data we need without ever under- or over-fetching. We can also get multiple resources in a single request. At the same time, the requests themselves can serve as a form of documentation, making it is easy to understand what data is being used, where, and why.

But the most exciting feature of GraphQL is that the API is fully described by its schema, including all data types for each possible query or mutation.

Why does this matter?

Because, based on that schema, we can automatically create TypeScript types for the entire API on the frontend. What’s more is we can easily autogenerate fully-typed custom React hooks for a data-fetching library like [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

Let me show you how.

## Setting up the project with GraphQL

### React app

> 建个基础模板

First, let’s create our React project with Create React App with the TypeScript template.

```
yarn create react-app graphql --template typescript
```

### GraphQL API

> 搞个API服务器. 定义点数据, 方便案例调用

Next, we need an API. [FakeQL](https://fakeql.com/) provides a great way to create a mock GraphQL API and deploy it. Because we will be using the default definition, we can set everything up simply by clicking Extend JSON and then Deploy. The tool generates a unique URL where we can access our new API.

### Data-fetching library

> 开始接入数据

Now that we have our React app and our API, it is time to set up our data-fetching library, React Query.

Let’s install it:

```
yarn add react-query
```

Now, set up the React Query client.

```jsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query'

import Posts from 'components/Posts'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

const App = () => {
    return (
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
            <Posts />
        </QueryClientProvider>
    )
}

export default App
```

### Component

Because our API provides a list of posts, we will use a `Posts` component to display them. For the moment, let’s leave it empty.

```jsx
// components/Posts.tsx

const Posts = () => {
    return (
        <></>
    )
}

export default Posts
```

Next, we need a query to get the list of posts. Let’s define it in a `.graphql` file and co-locate it with our component:

```jsx
# components/Posts/posts.graphql

query Posts {
    posts {
        id
        title
    }
}
```

Finally, let’s also add a mutation for deleting a post:


```jsx
# components/Posts/deletePost.graphql

mutation DeletePost($id: ID!) {
    deletePost(id: $id)
}
```

## Auto-generate typed React Query hooks with TypeScript and GraphQL Codegen

> 现在可以根据请求条件生成自定义和完整类型的React Query hooks库
We are now ready to auto-generate our custom and fully typed React Query hooks based on the requests we previously defined in our .`graphql` files. We will be using [GraphQL Code Generator.](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)

We start by installing it:

> 加入graphql插件

```elm
yarn add graphql 
yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli
```

Next, we need to initialize the wizard and go through the steps:

> 初始化graphql插件

```elm
yarn graphql-codegen init
```
> 选择类型方式构造app
First, we choose the type of app we are building:

> 启动FakeQL url, 预览图表数据
Then, we define our schema is by pasting our FakeQL url.

We define where our operations and fragments are:

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1C8EAE8DC9F518921163B24338607F32918C4F1A5CC5D807CB9302033C4F0861_1614500628662_image.png)

We choose our plugins:

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1C8EAE8DC9F518921163B24338607F32918C4F1A5CC5D807CB9302033C4F0861_1614500777731_image.png)

We choose where to write the output:

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1C8EAE8DC9F518921163B24338607F32918C4F1A5CC5D807CB9302033C4F0861_1614500850352_image.png)

Let’s also generate an introspection file:

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1C8EAE8DC9F518921163B24338607F32918C4F1A5CC5D807CB9302033C4F0861_1614500882216_image.png)

We need to name our config file:

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1C8EAE8DC9F518921163B24338607F32918C4F1A5CC5D807CB9302033C4F0861_1614500917361_image.png)

Finally, let’s name our script `graphql:codegen`:

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1C8EAE8DC9F518921163B24338607F32918C4F1A5CC5D807CB9302033C4F0861_1614500962771_image.png)

So far, so good!

In order to generate custom React Query hooks, we need to install the appropriate plugin:

```elm
yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/typescript-react-query
```

And add a quick edit of the codegen.yml config file in order to make it work:

```js
overwrite: true
schema: 'https://fakeql.com/graphql/2aaf00462236e8280f4c3beb197aae54'
documents: 'src/**/*.graphql'
generates:
    src/generated/index.ts:
        plugins:
            - typescript
            - typescript-operations
            - typescript-react-query
        config:
            fetcher:
                endpoint: 'https://fakeql.com/graphql/2aaf00462236e8280f4c3beb197aae54'
```

Finally, we need to run our script.

```elm
yarn graphql:codegen
```

We are now done! Our fully-typed custom React Query hooks have been automatically generated and added directly to our project’s `generated` folder.

Let’s see them in action!

## Making API requests

In our `Posts` component, we are now ready to display the list of posts:

```react
import { usePostsQuery } from 'generated'

const Posts = () => {
    const { data } = usePostsQuery()
     return (
            <>
                {isLoading && <p>Loading ...</p>}
                {data &&
                    data.posts?.map(post => (
                        <div key={post?.id}>
                            <p>{post?.title}</p>
                            <hr />
                        </div>
                    ))}
            </>
        )
}

export default Posts
```

Let’s also add the `DeletePost` mutation we defined earlier.

```react
import { useQueryClient } from 'react-query'
import { usePostsQuery, useDeletePostMutation } from 'generated'

const Posts = () => {
    const queryClient = useQueryClient()
    const { data, isLoading } = usePostsQuery()
    const { mutate } = useDeletePostMutation({
        onSuccess: () => queryClient.invalidateQueries('Posts'),
    })

    return (
        <>
            {isLoading && <p>Loading ...</p>}
            {data &&
                data.posts?.map(post => (
                    <div key={post?.id}>
                        <p>{post?.title}</p>
                        <button onClick={() => post && mutate({ id: post.id })}>
                            Delete
                        </button>
                        <hr />
                    </div>
                ))}
        </>
    )
}

export default Posts
```

That’s it, we now have a working example!

## Conclusion

> 1. 通用使用自动生成的graphql脚本文件, 我们可以节省一部分请求数据时所需要的样式代码

The approach described above allows us to take full advantage of GraphQL on the frontend by automating both the creation of TypeScript types for the API and the generation of custom React Query hooks for each request.

By using it, we have also substantially reduced the amount of data-fetching boilerplate code we need to write. With this tooling in place, all we need to do in order to create additional React Query custom hooks for a request is to create a `.graphql` file and run the `graphql:codegen` script. Pretty cool, right?
